Multicriteria optimization of deformation-induced martensite transformation during external longitudinal turning

Use of ML method Adaboost algorithm and genetic algorithm optimization. 

The properties of metastable austenitic steels allow mechanically induced transformation of the microstructure during external longitudinal turning. 
Under cryogenic conditions, martensite is generated from the austenite material in the peripheral zone of the workpiece. This work investigates the selective adjustment of the
properties in the form of the martensite content and the surface roughness. 
For this purpose, a machine learning methodology is combined with metaheuristics. Modeling of the martensite content is performed based on measured variables and process temperatures. For modeling an Adaboost algorithm and a 
Gaussian process regression is used. The prediction of the surface roughness 
is implemented using linear regression. Subsequently, a genetic 
optimization algorithm determines the compatibility of the target variables and outputs suitable process variables for the turning process.
